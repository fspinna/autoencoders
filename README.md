# Install

The code is still under development. You can download the code or clone the repository from github or directly install it:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/fspinna/autoencoders.git
```
It is recommended to install it in a fresh conda environment (Python 3.7).

# Notebooks
You can find a [Notebook](https://github.com/fspinna/autoencoders/blob/main/notebooks/vae_example.ipynb) example (it works also in Google Colab).
